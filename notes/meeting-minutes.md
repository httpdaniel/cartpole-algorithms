# Meeting Minutes - Week 1
 
**Date:** Friday March 12th, 2021\
**Time:** 12:00PM

### Agenda Items
* Discuss algorithms to be used
* Delegate tasks to group members

### Minutes
**Agenda Item 1 - Discuss algorithms to be used**
* The group discussed the possible algorithms that can be used to solve Cartpole.
* Deep Q-Learning and a Genetic Algorithm were chosen as two of the algorithms.

**Agenda Item 2 - Delegate tasks to group members**
* The group discussed the initial tasks to be carried out and these were delegated to the group members.

### Action Items
* Each member has been assigned a task as outlined in the todo list.



# Meeting Minutes - Week 2
 
**Date:** Friday March 19th, 2021\
**Time:** 12:00PM

### Agenda Items
* Discuss work done so far
* Discuss third algorithm

### Minutes
**Agenda Item 1 - Discuss work done so far**
* The group members discussed all of the work they have carried out so far in the project.
* Some members have started implementing while others are researching.

**Agenda Item 2 - Discuss third algorithm**
* The group had a discussion on what to use for the third algorithm in the project.
* This was broken down to 3 algorithms that members are researching over the coming days.

### Action Items
* The group members are going to continue the implementation of their delegated algorithm whilst others carry out research.



# Meeting Minutes - Week 3
 
**Date:** Monday March 29th, 2021\
**Time:** 16:00PM

### Agenda Items
* Discuss statistics to compare algorithms
* Discuss final report

### Minutes
**Agenda Item 1 - Discuss statistics to compare algorithms**
* The group members discussed ways in which the three algorithms can be compared.
* We decided to use a common convergence condition (reward â‰¥ 195 for 100 iterations in a row).
* When this condition is met, the time taken, final reward, and episodes taken, are recorded for comparison. 

**Agenda Item 2 - Discuss final report**
* The group had a discussion on the final report and how to collectively work on it.
* We have decided to use a group LaTeX document on Overleaf for this.
* This will be added to the Github incrementally as sections are added.

### Action Items
* The group members are going to continue the implementation of each algorithm.
* The LaTeX document will be set up on Overleaf.



# Meeting Minutes - Week 4

**Date:** Friday April 9th, 2021\
**Time:** 12:00PM

### Agenda Items
* Discuss final results
* Discuss project report

### Minutes
**Agenda Item 1 - Discuss final results**
* Since all algorithms have been finalised, the group members discussed the results found for each.
* The following 4 metrics were used: Final  reward, Average reward, Episodes taken, Time taken

**Agenda Item 2 - Discuss project report**
* The group members discussed the final report and how to delegate the work.
* Members also reviewed the first draft of the introduction and problem description. 

### Action Items
* Each group member will provide a description of the algorithm they implemented on the report.
* Final results will also be added to the report.
