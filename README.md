# Cartpole Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of algorithms used to solve the Cartpole environment on [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/).


## Project Dependencies
1. Python3 (Note: ensure you have python mapped to the python3 environment variable)
2. NumPy
3. Sci-kit learn (Note: ensure 0.22.1 is the version of Sci-kit learn is being used)
4. Matplotlib (Note: ensure that your operating system is able to use the TKAgg function)
5. Keras (Note: ensure you are using a tensorflow backend and 2.4.3 is the version of Keras used)
6. Tensorflow (ensure 2.4.1 is the version of Tensorflow learn is being used)
7. Pillow
8. pip (Note: ensure you have pip mapped to the pip3 environment variable)

# Install the Projects dependancies
To Install the project dependancies run the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

# Running the Project
The following steps detail how to run the Artificial Intelligence Project:
1. Use the cd command in order to navigate to the "algorithms" directory
2. Run python Plotter.py to see the results of all the algorithms and baseline
3. Run python Baseline.py to see the results of the Baseline alone
4. Run python CartpoleDQN.py to see the results of the CartpoleDQN alone
5. Run python Genetic.py to see the results of the Genetic alone
6. Run python PIDController.py to see the results of the PIDController alone

## Project Dependencies:
1. Java (Version 8 or greater)
2. Maven (Version 3.6.0)
3. Python3 (Note: ensure you have python mapped to the python3 environment variable and specific version of all the Python dependencies can be found in requirements.txt)
4. Matplotlib (Note: ensure that your operating system is able to use the TKAgg function)
5. pip (Note: ensure you have pip mapped to the pip3 environment variable)
6. Bash (Version 3.2)
